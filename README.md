## Algorithm Architecture - Two-Stage Optimization

### Stage 1: Parallel Anchor Testing with Range Scanning
Revolutionary approach that tests multiple potential anchors simultaneously while scanning entire ranges for optimal pivot placement.

### Stage 2: Global Range Optimization
After each pivot confirmation, relocates previous pivots to true extremes between opposite pivot types.

## Core Pivot Detection Rules

### 1. Three-Bar Detection Pattern

Every pivot detection requires exactly **3 bars**: Anchor, B1, and B2

#### Small Pivot High (SPH) Rules:
- **Anchor**: Any bar being tested as potential pivot
- **B1**: First bar after Anchor with **lower low** AND **lower close** than Anchor
- **B2**: Second bar after Anchor with **lower low** AND **lower close** than Anchor
- **Pivot Location**: The bar with **highest high** in the **entire range** from Anchor to B2

#### Small Pivot Low (SPL) Rules:
- **Anchor**: Any bar being tested as potential pivot  
- **B1**: First bar after Anchor with **higher high** AND **higher close** than Anchor
- **B2**: Second bar after Anchor with **higher high** AND **higher close** than Anchor
- **Pivot Location**: The bar with **lowest low** in the **entire range** from Anchor to B2

### 2. Bar Spacing Rules - Maximum Flexibility

**CRITICAL**: Anchor, B1, and B2 can have ANY spacing between them:
- ✅ **Consecutive**: A=1, B1=2, B2=3
- ✅ **Gaps**: A=1, B1=4, B2=7  
- ✅ **Mixed**: A=5, B1=6, B2=9
- ✅ **Large Gaps**: A=10, B1=25, B2=50

### 3. Alternation Rules - Strict Enforcement

- **First Pivot**: Always SPH (provides market direction head start)
- **Strict Alternation**: SPH → SPL → SPH → SPL → SPH → ...
- **No Exceptions**: Algorithm never places two consecutive pivots of same type
- **Pattern Completion**: Only confirmed when complete A,B1,B2 found with proper alternation

## Revolutionary Parallel Anchor Testing Algorithm

### How It Works

Instead of testing one anchor against all remaining bars, the algorithm tests multiple potential anchors simultaneously as new bars arrive.

#### Sequential "Parallel" Processing:

```
After SPH at bar 8, start looking for SPL:

Bar 10 arrives:
  - Test anchor 9 (look for B1 in bar 10) → No B1 found
  - Add anchor 10 to potential list

Bar 11 arrives:  
  - Test anchor 9 (look for B1 in bars 10,11) → No B1 found
  - Test anchor 10 (look for B1 in bar 11) → No B1 found
  - Add anchor 11 to potential list

Bar 12 arrives:
  - Test anchor 9 (look for B1 in bars 10,11,12) → No B1 found
  - Test anchor 10 (look for B1 in bars 11,12) → No B1 found  
  - Test anchor 11 (look for B1 in bar 12) → No B1 found
  - Add anchor 12 to potential list

Bar 13 arrives:
  - Test anchor 9 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 10 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 11 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 12 (B1=13 found, need B2)
  - Add anchor 13 to potential list

Bar 14 arrives:
  - Test anchor 9 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 10 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 11 → No complete pattern
  - Test anchor 12 (B1=13, B2=14 - COMPLETE!) ✓
  - SPL confirmed at bar 12!
```

### Key Benefits

#### ✅ **Immediate Trend Detection**
- Catches reversals at actual turning points
- No delayed detection due to distant pattern searching
- Eliminates "bar 129 vs bar 218" type discrepancies

#### ✅ **Natural Market Flow**
- Follows actual market structure without artificial constraints
- No arbitrary range limitations or timeouts
- Market data itself determines pattern timing

#### ✅ **Non-Sequential Pattern Support**
- Handles patterns like A=12, B1=15, B2=18 (gaps at 13,14,16,17)
- Takes first qualifying bar for B1, first qualifying bar after B1 for B2
- Supports any spacing configuration naturally

## Two-Stage Optimization Process

### Stage 1: Enhanced Pattern Detection

When A,B1,B2 pattern is found, algorithm performs **full range scanning**:

#### Example - SPH Detection:
```
Pattern Found: Anchor=33, B1=39, B2=40

Instead of only checking bars 33, 39, 40:
- Scan ENTIRE range from bar 33 to bar 40
- Check bars: 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40
- Find bar with highest HIGH in this range
- Place SPH at the actual highest bar (e.g., bar 35)

Result: SPH correctly placed at bar 35, not bar 33
```

#### Example - SPL Detection:
```
Pattern Found: Anchor=47, B1=48, B2=49

Scan entire range 47-49:
- Check all bars in range for lowest LOW
- Place SPL at actual lowest bar in range
```

### Stage 2: Global Range Optimization

After each new pivot is confirmed, algorithm relocates previous pivot to global extreme:

#### SPH Relocation (when SPL is found):
```
Scenario:
- Previous SPL at bar 32
- Current SPH at bar 35 (from Stage 1)  
- New SPL found at bar 47

Stage 2 Process:
1. Identify range between SPLs: bars 32 to 47
2. Scan ENTIRE range 32-47 for highest HIGH
3. If bar other than 35 has higher high, relocate SPH
4. Ensures SPH is at absolute highest between the two SPLs

Console Output:
"✓ SPH RELOCATED: Bar 35 → Bar 36 (4897.00 → 4915.00)"
OR
"✓ SPH already at optimal position: Bar 35"
```

#### SPL Relocation (when SPH is found):
```
Scenario:
- Previous SPH at bar 35
- Current SPL at bar 47
- New SPH found at bar 52

Stage 2 Process:
1. Identify range between SPHs: bars 35 to 52
2. Scan ENTIRE range 35-52 for lowest LOW
3. Relocate SPL to actual lowest bar in range
4. Ensures SPL is at absolute lowest between the two SPHs
```

## Detailed Algorithm Examples

### Example 1: Immediate Reversal Detection
```
Market Data:
Bars:     [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
Trend:     SPH ↓   ↓    ↓    ↓    ↑    ↑    ↑
Highs:     500 485  475  465  455  470  485  495
Lows:      495 480  470  460  450  465  480  490

Process:
1. SPH found at bar 8
2. Search starts from bar 9 for SPL
3. Bars 9,10,11,12 tested as anchors simultaneously
4. When bar 14 arrives:
   - Anchor 12 completes pattern: A=12, B1=13, B2=14
   - Stage 1: SPL placed at bar 12 (lowest in range 12-14)
   - Stage 2: No relocation needed (first pivot pair)

Result: SPL correctly found at actual turning point (bar 12)
```

### Example 2: Non-Sequential Pattern with Gaps
```
Market Data:
Bars:     [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]
Pattern:   Anc  ↓    ↓    ↑    ↓    ↓    ↑    ↓    ↑
Highs:     480  475  470  485  465  460  490  455  495
Lows:      475  470  465  480  460  455  485  450  490

Process:
1. Test anchor 10 starting at bar 11
2. Bar 13: qualifies as B1 (higher high + higher close vs anchor 10)
3. Bars 14,15: don't qualify as B2
4. Bar 16: qualifies as B2 (higher high + higher close vs anchor 10)
5. Pattern: A=10, B1=13, B2=16 (gaps at bars 11,12,14,15)
6. Stage 1: Scan range 10-16, find lowest at bar 15
7. SPL placed at bar 15 (actual lowest in range)

Result: Non-sequential pattern handled naturally with optimal placement
```

### Example 3: Stage 2 Optimization in Action
```
Market Sequence:
1. SPL at bar 25 (Stage 1)
2. SPH at bar 35 (Stage 1 + Stage 2 check)
3. SPL at bar 50 (Stage 1 + Stage 2 optimization)

Stage 2 Process for step 3:
- Previous SPH at bar 35
- New SPL at bar 50  
- Scan range 25-50 for highest HIGH
- If bar 38 has highest high in range 25-50:
  - Relocate SPH from bar 35 to bar 38
  - Update price from 4897.00 to 4925.00
- Scan range 35-50 for lowest LOW
- Confirm SPL at optimal position in range
```

### Example 4: Complex Market Scenario
```
Real Market Conditions:
- Multiple small bounces and dips
- Non-obvious turning points
- Mixed consecutive and gap patterns

Algorithm Handling:
1. Parallel testing prevents missed immediate reversals
2. Stage 1 ensures pivots at actual extremes in detected ranges
3. Stage 2 globally optimizes for true extremes between pivot pairs
4. Result: Pivots at actual market structure turning points
```

## Large Pivot Detection Rules

### Large Pivot High (LPH) Detection:
**Trigger Condition**: When an SPL breaks below a previous SPL level
**Action**: Mark the highest SPH between the last LPL and the breaking SPL as LPH

#### Example:
```
SPL Sequence: SPL1(low=4800) → SPL2(low=4750) → SPL3(low=4700)
When SPL3 breaks below SPL2:
1. Identify SPHs between last LPL and SPL3
2. Find highest SPH in this range
3. Mark as LPH (permanent designation)
```

### Large Pivot Low (LPL) Detection:
**Trigger Condition**: When an SPH breaks above a previous SPH level  
**Action**: Mark the lowest SPL between the last LPH and the breaking SPH as LPL

#### Example:
```
SPH Sequence: SPH1(high=4900) → SPH2(high=4950) → SPH3(high=5000)
When SPH3 breaks above SPH2:
1. Identify SPLs between last LPH and SPH3
2. Find lowest SPL in this range  
3. Mark as LPL (permanent designation)
```

### Large Pivot Characteristics:
- **Permanent**: Once marked, large pivots never change location
- **Hierarchical**: Based on breaks of small pivot levels
- **Trend Significant**: Indicate major market structure changes

## Search Progression and Continuation Rules

### Basic Progression:
1. **Initialize** search from Bar 0
2. **Form first pivot** (always SPH for directional head start)
3. **Start parallel anchor testing** from B2 position of confirmed pivot
4. **Continue until** no more valid patterns can be found

### Pattern Completion Requirements:
- **A,B1,B2 must be found** in sequence (with any spacing)
- **Alternation must be respected** (SPH→SPL→SPH→SPL)
- **B1 and B2 must meet** higher/lower criteria vs Anchor
- **First complete pattern wins** when multiple anchors compete

### Search Termination:
- **No more valid patterns** can be found from current position
- **End of data** reached with insufficient bars remaining
- **All potential anchors exhausted** without finding complete patterns
